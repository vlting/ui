# Component Contract — TriggerSelector

## 1. Public API

### Base Props

`TriggerSelector` is implemented as a Tamagui `styled(YStack)` and therefore accepts all Tamagui / React Native `View` props, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Layout | `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `flex`, `flexDirection` |
| Spacing | `padding`, `paddingHorizontal`, `margin`, `gap` (space tokens) |
| Visual | `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`, `borderRadius`, `opacity` |
| Theme | `theme`, `themeInverse` |
| Animation | `animation`, `enterStyle`, `exitStyle` |
| Accessibility | `accessible`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, `aria-*` |
| Events | `onPress`, `onHoverIn`, `onHoverOut`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` |

### Component-Specific Props

No additional props are defined in the current stub implementation. Props specific to the component's behavior (e.g., data, state, callbacks) are to be defined when behavioral logic is implemented per the `.spec.md`.

## 2. Behavioral Guarantees

idle (closed), open (browsing/searching), selected, disabled.

- Keyboard behavior:
- Screen reader behavior: trigger button announces selected trigger or "Select a trigger". Panel has `role="listbox"`. Options have `role="option"` and `aria-selected`. Category headings use `role="group"` with a label.


### This component will never:

- Fetch data, call APIs, or contain business logic.
- Enforce RBAC or domain rules.
- Assume application routing context.
- Introduce cross-component shared state.

---

## 3. Accessibility Guarantees

- Exposes appropriate ARIA role for its context.
- Focus must be visible and never trapped.
- All visible text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1).
- Reduced motion: no panel animation when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active.

---

## 4. Styling Guarantees

- Required tokens: trigger button background, trigger button border, panel background, option hover/selected background, option label color, option description color, category heading color, search input background, search input border, empty state text color, icon color, focus ring color.
- Prohibited hardcoded values: no raw colors, no pixel spacing or font sizes.
- Dark mode: selected and hover states remain visually distinct in dark theme.


- Supports theming extension without breaking existing contracts.

## 5. Breaking Change Criteria

The following constitute breaking changes and require a major version bump:

- Removing any currently accepted prop.
- Changing the type or default value of an existing prop in a way that alters behavior.
- Changing keyboard interaction semantics (e.g., which key triggers an action).
- Changing ARIA role or landmark structure.
- Removing a named static sub-component (e.g., `TriggerSelector.Item`).
- Changing controlled/uncontrolled state behavior.
- Dropping support for a previously guaranteed theme token.
- Altering the DOM/native element structure in a way that breaks styling contracts.
