# Component Contract — AuthProfileEditor

## 1. Public API

### Base Props

`AuthProfileEditor` is implemented as a Tamagui `styled(YStack)` and therefore accepts all Tamagui / React Native `View` props, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Layout | `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `flex`, `flexDirection` |
| Spacing | `padding`, `paddingHorizontal`, `margin`, `gap` (space tokens) |
| Visual | `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`, `borderRadius`, `opacity` |
| Theme | `theme`, `themeInverse` |
| Animation | `animation`, `enterStyle`, `exitStyle` |
| Accessibility | `accessible`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, `aria-*` |
| Events | `onPress`, `onHoverIn`, `onHoverOut`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` |

### Component-Specific Props

No additional props are defined in the current stub implementation. Props specific to the component's behavior (e.g., data, state, callbacks) are to be defined when behavioral logic is implemented per the `.spec.md`.

## 2. Behavioral Guarantees

idle, focused, filled, error, disabled, read-only.
- Form-level states: pristine (no changes), dirty (unsaved changes), submitting, error, success.

- Keyboard behavior:
- Screen reader behavior: each field announces its label, current value, and any error message when focused. Form-level errors are announced via a live region.


### This component will never:

- Fetch data, call APIs, or contain business logic.
- Enforce RBAC or domain rules.
- Assume application routing context.
- Introduce cross-component shared state.

---

## 3. Accessibility Guarantees

- Exposes appropriate ARIA role for its context.
- Focus must be visible and never trapped.
- All visible text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1).
- Reduced motion: no animated transitions on validation state changes.

---

## 4. Styling Guarantees

- Required tokens: input background, input border, input border-focused, input border-error, label text color, placeholder text color, error text color, hint text color, button background, button text, surface background.
- Prohibited hardcoded values: no raw color hex/rgb, no pixel font sizes, no hardcoded padding values.
- Dark mode: all token references resolve under the active theme; error and success states remain distinct in both light and dark contexts.


- Supports theming extension without breaking existing contracts.

---

## 5. Breaking Change Criteria

The following constitute breaking changes and require a major version bump:

- Removing any currently accepted prop.
- Changing the type or default value of an existing prop in a way that alters behavior.
- Changing keyboard interaction semantics (e.g., which key triggers an action).
- Changing ARIA role or landmark structure.
- Removing a named static sub-component (e.g., `AuthProfileEditor.Item`).
- Changing controlled/uncontrolled state behavior.
- Dropping support for a previously guaranteed theme token.
- Altering the DOM/native element structure in a way that breaks styling contracts.
