# Component Contract — HeatmapOverlay

## 1. Public API

### Base Props

`HeatmapOverlay` is implemented as a Tamagui `styled(YStack)` and therefore accepts all Tamagui / React Native `View` props, including:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Layout | `width`, `height`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `flex`, `flexDirection` |
| Spacing | `padding`, `paddingHorizontal`, `margin`, `gap` (space tokens) |
| Visual | `backgroundColor`, `borderColor`, `borderRadius`, `opacity` |
| Theme | `theme`, `themeInverse` |
| Animation | `animation`, `enterStyle`, `exitStyle` |
| Accessibility | `accessible`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityRole`, `aria-*` |
| Events | `onPress`, `onHoverIn`, `onHoverOut`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` |

### Component-Specific Props

No additional props are defined in the current stub implementation. Props specific to the component's behavior (e.g., data, state, callbacks) are to be defined when behavioral logic is implemented per the `.spec.md`.

## 2. Behavioral Guarantees

- Renders without error when valid props are supplied.


- Screen reader behavior: the overlay is decorative and must be hidden from the accessibility tree (`aria-hidden="true"`).


### This component will never:

- Fetch data, call APIs, or contain business logic.
- Enforce RBAC or domain rules.
- Assume application routing context.
- Introduce cross-component shared state.

---

## 3. Accessibility Guarantees

- Exposes appropriate ARIA role for its context.
- Focus must be visible and never trapped.
- All visible text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1).
- Animations are disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set.

---

## 4. Styling Guarantees

- Required tokens: color tokens for the low-density and high-density ends of the gradient, opacity token for overlay transparency, transition duration token for data updates.
- No hardcoded color, spacing, or font-size values.
- Dark mode: gradient color tokens must be defined for dark map themes; lighter gradients may be appropriate on dark map tiles.


- Supports theming extension without breaking existing contracts.

## 5. Breaking Change Criteria

The following constitute breaking changes and require a major version bump:

- Removing any currently accepted prop.
- Changing the type or default value of an existing prop in a way that alters behavior.
- Changing keyboard interaction semantics (e.g., which key triggers an action).
- Changing ARIA role or landmark structure.
- Removing a named static sub-component (e.g., `HeatmapOverlay.Item`).
- Changing controlled/uncontrolled state behavior.
- Dropping support for a previously guaranteed theme token.
- Altering the DOM/native element structure in a way that breaks styling contracts.
