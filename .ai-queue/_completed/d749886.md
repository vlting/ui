# Rewrite Checkbox + RadioGroup + Switch + Select using Tamagui official components

## Context

This is part of a broader effort to leverage Tamagui's official component packages instead of building from scratch with `styled(XStack/View)`. Tamagui's components render correct semantic HTML, handle ARIA attributes, and support keyboard navigation out of the box. They all use theme tokens (`$background`, `$borderColor`, etc.) that our brand system provides.

## Implementation

### Checkbox (`packages/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx`)

Replaced with `@tamagui/checkbox`. Uses TamaguiCheckbox directly with ComponentType cast for v2 RC. Label text clicking forwards to checkbox via ref.

### RadioGroup (`packages/components/RadioGroup/RadioGroup.tsx`)

Replaced with `@tamagui/radio-group`. Uses TamaguiRadioGroup with Item/Indicator. Removed custom roving tabindex and arrow-key handling — Tamagui handles this.

### Switch (`packages/components/Switch/Switch.tsx`)

Replaced with `@tamagui/switch`. Uses TamaguiSwitch with Thumb. Removed custom useControllableState and native button/hidden input wrappers.

### Select (`packages/components/Select/Select.tsx`)

Replaced with `@tamagui/select`. Maps our simplified API (Select/Select.Item) to Tamagui's compound structure (Trigger/Content/Viewport/Item/ItemText). Removed all custom state management.

## Scope

- `packages/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx`
- `packages/components/RadioGroup/RadioGroup.tsx`
- `packages/components/Switch/Switch.tsx`
- `packages/components/Select/Select.tsx`
