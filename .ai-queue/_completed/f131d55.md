# A11y: Button — Semantic HTML, Hover States, Contrast Fix

## Result
- Added `tag: 'button'` to ButtonFrame — renders native `<button>` for keyboard focus and Enter/Space activation
- Added per-variant `hoverStyle`: solid → `$color11` (darker), outline/ghost → `$backgroundHover`
- Added `appearance: 'none'` to reset browser default button styling
- Loading state now includes `<VisuallyHidden>Loading</VisuallyHidden>` for screen reader text
- Contrast fix (`$color1` text on solid) and tone variants via Theme wrapper were already implemented in prior cycle
- Build verified clean (963 modules, 515KB gzip 160KB)
