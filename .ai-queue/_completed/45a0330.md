# 004 — DatePicker & DateRangePicker: Hover Contrast on Selected Dates

## Objective

When hovering over selected start/end dates in the DatePicker and DateRangePicker, the background changes to `$backgroundHover` (very light) while the text stays `$color1` (also light) — resulting in zero contrast. The selected state's hover should maintain visual distinction.

## Context

- `DayCell` has `hoverStyle: { backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover' }` (palette[1] = very light).
- The `selected` variant sets `backgroundColor: '$color10'` (dark primary) and `DayText` sets `color: '$color1'` (white).
- On hover, the background flips to light but text stays light = invisible text.
- This is the exact same pattern as the Pagination hover bug.

## Tasks

1. **Fix `DayCell` in `packages/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.tsx`**:
   - Override `hoverStyle` for the `selected` variant: use `backgroundColor: '$color11'` (slightly darker than `$color10`) or a similar approach that maintains contrast with `$color1` text.
   - Alternatively, make the selected variant's hoverStyle keep `$color10` background (no change on hover) or add a subtle brightness shift.

2. **Fix `DayCell` in `packages/components/DatePicker/DateRangePicker.tsx`**:
   - Apply the same fix if `DayCell` is defined separately here. If it imports from DatePicker, the fix in step 1 may cover both.
   - Check whether `DayCell` is shared or duplicated between the two files.

3. **Also check `inRange` variant hover**: When hovering over dates in the range (between start and end), ensure the hover background doesn't break contrast with `inRange` text color either.

4. **Test across light and dark themes** with all brands to ensure consistent readability.

## Scope

- `packages/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.tsx`
- `packages/components/DatePicker/DateRangePicker.tsx`
