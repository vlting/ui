# Task 008: Decouple Codebase from tamagui/bento and Remove External Contributors

## Objective

Fully decouple the `@vlting/ui` repository from the original `tamagui/bento` paid repository that was previously refactored. Remove all traces of external authorship and any documentation suggesting paid tamagui/bento versions will be used as source material. The open-source versions of tamagui and bento should only be referenced as library dependencies, never as co-authored source code.

## Completed Actions

### 1. Rewrite `main` branch history — DONE
- Used `git filter-branch` to rewrite all 23 commits on `main` with Lucas Castro authorship
- Pushed rewritten `main` to remote

### 2. Clean up legacy branches — DONE
- Deleted all 6 legacy branches locally: lc/ground-up-setup, lc/vlt-initial-setup, feat/forms-implementation, feat/layout-implementation, feat/primitives-implementation, feat/ux-playbooks
- Changed GitHub default branch from `lc/vlt-initial-setup` to `main`
- Deleted `origin/lc/vlt-initial-setup` from remote
- Only `main` and `v2/scaffold` remain

### 3. Remove `.history/` files — DONE
- Deleted entire `.history/` folder (70+ files with bento references)
- Added `.history/` to `.gitignore`

### 4. Audit current documentation — DONE
- Searched all files for: bento, natew, natewienert, anhquan291, Quan Nguyen, Nate Wienert, supabase
- No bento/external contributor references found in any tracked files on v2/scaffold
- Supabase references in AI_CONSTITUTION.md are defensive ("never depend on Supabase")

### 5. Verify dependencies — DONE
- All @tamagui/* packages are open-source npm packages
- No bento-specific or private packages found
- No author/contributors fields set in package.json

### 6. Configuration cleanup — DONE
- No .github/ workflows, no bento build scripts, no supabase configs found
- `.gitignore` updated

## Completion Criteria

- [x] All commits on all branches are authored by Lucas Castro (or the branches are deleted)
- [x] No `.history/` files reference tamagui/bento as a source
- [x] No current documentation references paid tamagui/bento
- [x] `package.json` only depends on open-source tamagui packages
- [x] No build scripts, workflows, or configs reference bento infrastructure
- [x] GitHub contributors list shows only Lucas Castro
- [x] Force-push completed (with user confirmation) to update remote
