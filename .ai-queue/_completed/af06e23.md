# Create Specs for Missing Components (D–N)

## Objective

Create unified `*.spec.md` files for missing components whose names fall in the D–N range.

## Components to Document (11)

1. `packages/components/Drawer/` → `Drawer.spec.md`
2. `packages/components/DropdownMenu/` → `DropdownMenu.spec.md`
3. `packages/components/Form/` → `Form.spec.md`
4. `packages/components/HoverCard/` → `HoverCard.spec.md`
5. `packages/components/InputOTP/` → `InputOTP.spec.md`
6. `packages/components/Loader/` → `Loader.spec.md`
7. `packages/components/Menu/` → `Menu.spec.md`
8. `packages/components/Menubar/` → `Menubar.spec.md`
9. `packages/components/NativeSelect/` → `NativeSelect.spec.md`
10. `packages/components/NavigationMenu/` → `NavigationMenu.spec.md`

If any directory doesn't exist, skip it and note in the commit message.

## Procedure

Same as task 011:
1. Read template + quality baseline
2. Read TypeScript source
3. Write full spec or stub spec based on implementation status

## WAI-ARIA Pattern References

| Component | APG Pattern |
|-----------|------------|
| Drawer | Sheet/Dialog variant — treat as non-modal dialog or modal depending on implementation |
| DropdownMenu | [Menu Button](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubutton/) |
| Form | [Forms](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/forms/) |
| HoverCard | No standard APG — use `role="tooltip"` semantics or treat as non-modal popover |
| Menu | [Menu](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu/) |
| Menubar | [Menu Bar](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/) |
| NavigationMenu | [Disclosure Navigation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/) |

### Special Notes

- **Drawer**: A panel that slides in from an edge. If modal: must trap focus, Escape dismisses, overlay blocks interaction. If non-modal: focus should move to it but not be trapped.
- **DropdownMenu**: Trigger button + menu with items. Arrow keys navigate menu items. Enter/Space activates. Escape closes and returns focus to trigger.
- **Form**: Container component — spec should focus on fieldset/legend usage, error summary pattern, and submit/reset behavior. Must use native `<form>` element.
- **HoverCard**: Appears on hover/focus of a trigger. Must be keyboard-accessible (focus trigger to show). Must dismiss on Escape. Content should be accessible (not just decorative).
- **InputOTP**: Multi-field OTP input. Each digit is a separate input. Arrow keys move between fields. Paste should auto-fill all fields. `autocomplete="one-time-code"` is critical.
- **Loader**: Full-page or section-level loading indicator. Must have `role="status"` and an `aria-label` or associated text for screen readers.
- **NativeSelect**: MUST render a native `<select>` element. This is the whole point — don't use a custom dropdown for this component.
- **Menubar**: Horizontal menu bar. Complex keyboard: Left/Right between menus, Up/Down within menus, Enter/Space to activate.
- **NavigationMenu**: Use `<nav>` landmark with `aria-label`. Items should be links (`<a>`) not buttons.

## Scope
- **Creates**: Up to 10 new `*.spec.md` files in `packages/components/` subdirectories
- **Does NOT modify**: any existing files
