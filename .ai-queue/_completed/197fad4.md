# Commit History
- 197fad4 — docs(queue): update GH Projects conventions with real project number
- Project created: VLT-UI Roadmap (number 1) at https://github.com/orgs/vlting/projects/1
- Labels verified: epic, stage, iteration
- gh auth refreshed with project scope

# Set Up GitHub Projects Board and Conventions

## Objective

Create the VLT-UI Roadmap project board on GitHub and finalize the agent workflow conventions.

## Scope

- GitHub API calls via `gh` CLI (project creation, column config, labels)
- `.ai-queue/_docs/github-projects-conventions.md` (already exists — verify and update if needed)

## Prerequisites

The `gh` CLI must have the `project` scope. If not already done:
```bash
gh auth refresh -s read:project -s project
```

**If the user cannot or does not want to add the project scope**, skip the project board creation and document that agents should rely on GitHub Issues + PR linking only (no project board). The conventions doc already covers this fallback.

## Steps

### 1. Authenticate with Project Scope

```bash
gh auth refresh -s read:project -s project
```

Verify with:
```bash
gh project list --owner vlting
```

### 2. Create the Project Board

```bash
gh project create --title "VLT-UI Roadmap" --owner vlting
```

Note the returned project number.

### 3. Configure Board Columns

GitHub Projects v2 uses a "Status" single-select field with default values. Update via the GitHub UI if CLI doesn't support field editing:

Target columns:
- **Backlog** — planned work not yet started
- **In Progress** — actively being worked by agent(s)
- **In PR Review** — PR created, awaiting human review
- **Done** — merged to main

### 4. Verify Labels

These labels should already exist (created in segment 003):
- `epic` — Multi-stage initiative
- `stage` — Individual stage within an epic
- `iteration` — Fix from ITERATE phase

If missing, create them:
```bash
gh label create "epic" --description "Multi-stage initiative" --color "8B5CF6" --repo vlting/ui
gh label create "stage" --description "Individual stage within an epic" --color "3B82F6" --repo vlting/ui
gh label create "iteration" --description "Fix from ITERATE phase" --color "F59E0B" --repo vlting/ui
```

### 5. Update Conventions Doc

Read `.ai-queue/_docs/github-projects-conventions.md` and update:
- Add the actual project number (once created)
- Verify all `gh` commands work with the real project
- Add any missing conventions discovered during setup

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Project board exists (or fallback documented)
- [ ] Board has 4 columns: Backlog, In Progress, In PR Review, Done
- [ ] Labels verified (epic, stage, iteration)
- [ ] Conventions doc updated with real project number
- [ ] All `gh` commands in conventions doc are tested and working
