# Fix Missing Barrel Exports Breaking the Example App

## Problem

The example app fails to start with:
```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "./Popover" from "../../packages/components/index.ts"
```

## Root Cause

6 component directories are missing `index.ts` barrel export files:
- `packages/components/Empty/`
- `packages/components/Field/`
- `packages/components/Menu/`
- `packages/components/Popover/`
- `packages/components/Sheet/`
- `packages/components/Toast/`

4 of these (Popover, Sheet, Field, Empty) are already referenced by `packages/components/index.ts`, causing the Vite import resolution failure. Menu and Toast are missing barrels too but may not be referenced yet.

## Fix

For each missing directory, create an `index.ts` that re-exports from the component's main `.tsx` file. Follow the same pattern as existing components (e.g., `packages/components/Button/index.ts`).

Steps:
1. Read `packages/components/Button/index.ts` to see the barrel pattern
2. For each of the 6 directories, read the main `.tsx` file to identify what's exported
3. Create an `index.ts` that re-exports everything the parent `packages/components/index.ts` expects
4. Verify the example app starts: `cd examples/kitchen-sink && npx vite build --mode development` (or `yarn dev:kitchen-sink` with a quick check)

## Scope
- **Creates**:
  - `packages/components/Empty/index.ts`
  - `packages/components/Field/index.ts`
  - `packages/components/Menu/index.ts`
  - `packages/components/Popover/index.ts`
  - `packages/components/Sheet/index.ts`
  - `packages/components/Toast/index.ts`
- **Does NOT modify**: any existing files
