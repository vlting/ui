# 1️⃣ vlt-ui — Create Local `.spec.md` Files for Each Component

## Objective

Generate a `ComponentName.spec.md` file for every component in `vlt-ui`.

Each spec must live next to the component:
```
/packages/components/Button/Button.tsx
/packages/components/Button/Button.spec.md
```

## Rules

- Do not describe implementation details.
- Describe behavior and constraints only.
- If unclear, ask.

## Claude Instructions

For each component:

1. Read:
   - `AI_CONSTITUTION.md`
   - `DESIGN_CONSTITUTION.md`
   - Component source file

2. Generate a `.spec.md` file containing containing the following REQUIRED structure, with content specific to that component:

# Component Spec — <ComponentName>

## 1. Purpose

- What problem this component solves.
- When it should be used.
- When it should NOT be used.

---

## 2. UX Intent

- Primary interaction goal
- Expected user mental model
- UX laws applied (Jakob, Hick, Fitts, etc.)

---

## 3. Visual Behavior

- Layout rules
- Spacing expectations
- Typography rules
- Token usage
- Responsive behavior

---

## 4. Interaction Behavior

- States (idle, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Controlled vs uncontrolled
- Keyboard behavior
- Screen reader behavior
- Motion rules

---

## 5. Accessibility Requirements

- ARIA requirements
- Focus rules
- Contrast expectations
- Reduced motion behavior

---

## 6. Theming Rules

- Required tokens
- Prohibited hardcoded values
- Dark mode expectations

---

## 7. Composition Rules

- What can wrap it
- What it may contain
- Anti-patterns

---

## 8. Performance Constraints

- Memoization rules
- Virtualization (if applicable)
- Render boundaries

---

## 9. Test Requirements

- What must be tested
- Interaction cases
- Accessibility checks
