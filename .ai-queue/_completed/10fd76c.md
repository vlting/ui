# Fix useKeyboardNavigation Hook

## Problem
The `useKeyboardNavigation` hook doesn't work in the kitchen-sink example app. There is an **API mismatch** between the hook implementation and the demo usage:

- **Hook signature** (`packages/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.ts`): positional parameters `(items, activeIndex, setActiveIndex, options)`
- **HooksPage demo** (`examples/kitchen-sink/src/pages/HooksPage.tsx`): calls it with object syntax `({ itemCount, onActiveIndexChange, ... })` which doesn't match

The hook is marked `@deprecated` in favor of `@tamagui/roving-focus`, but it's still exported and demonstrated — so it must work correctly until it's actually removed.

## Tasks

1. **Fix the hook itself** (`packages/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.ts`):
   - Keep the current positional parameter API (it's clean and correct).
   - Remove the `@deprecated` annotation — this hook serves a valid purpose for headless/custom keyboard navigation patterns outside of Tamagui's roving-focus.
   - Verify the switch/case logic for `orientation: 'both'` — the empty string fallthrough (`case orientation === 'both' ? 'ArrowUp' : ''`) is fragile and may match unintended keys. Refactor to use explicit if/else or a cleaner pattern.

2. **Fix the HooksPage demo** (`examples/kitchen-sink/src/pages/HooksPage.tsx`):
   - Update the `useKeyboardNavigation` demo to use the correct positional parameter API: `useKeyboardNavigation(itemCount, activeIndex, setActiveIndex, { orientation, loop, onSelect })`.
   - Ensure the demo actually works: arrow keys should navigate between items, Enter/Space should trigger selection.
   - Add a visible focus indicator so keyboard navigation is visually obvious.

## Scope
- `packages/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.ts`
- `examples/kitchen-sink/src/pages/HooksPage.tsx`

## Acceptance Criteria
- The hook demo in the kitchen-sink app works: arrow keys navigate, Enter selects, Home/End jump to boundaries.
- The hook has no `@deprecated` tag.
- The switch/case logic is robust (no empty-string case matching).
