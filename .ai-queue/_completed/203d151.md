- `e4f6b5c` — feat(examples): add kitchen-sink app showcasing all components

# Task: Create a Kitchen Sink Example App

## Objective
Create a new example app at `./examples/kitchen-sink/` that showcases **every component** exported by `@vlting/ui`, organized into browsable sections, with the ability to switch between different brand configurations at runtime.

## Context

### Available Components (from `src/index.ts`)
- **Primitives (Layer 1):** Box, Stack, VStack, HStack, Text, Heading, Icon, Divider, Spacer, Portal
- **Headless (Layer 2):** HeadlessDialog, HeadlessTabs, HeadlessCheckbox
- **Styled Components (Layer 3):** Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Tabs
- **Hooks:** useControllableState, useFocusTrap, useKeyboardNavigation
- **Utils:** mergeRefs, composeEventHandlers, cn

### Available Brands
- `defaultBrand` — neutral gray palettes, Inter font (`packages/design-tokens/src/brands/default.ts`)
- `neonBrand` — vibrant cyan/teal palettes, uppercase headings, larger radii, snappier animations (`packages/design-tokens/src/brands/neon.ts`)

### Brand Switching Architecture
The `Provider` component (`src/provider/Provider.tsx`) wraps `TamaguiProvider` and accepts an optional `config` prop. The config is generated via `createBrandConfig(brand)` which produces a full `CreateTamaguiProps` object.

**IMPORTANT:** Tamagui's `TamaguiProvider` does NOT re-render when the `config` prop changes at runtime — it is designed to be set once. To support brand switching, use one of these approaches:

- **Recommended: Route-based brand switching.** Each brand gets its own route (e.g., `/default/...`, `/neon/...`) with its own `<Provider config={...}>` wrapper. Brand navigation triggers a full route change, which remounts the Provider. This avoids any reactivity issues and is architecturally clean.
- **Alternative: Key-based remount.** Use React's `key` prop on the Provider to force a remount when the brand changes (e.g., `<Provider key={brandName} config={config}>`). This is simpler but causes a full tree teardown/rebuild.

Choose the route-based approach as the primary strategy, with a brand selector in a top-level nav that navigates between brand routes.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Scaffold the Vite app
Follow the same pattern as `examples/volta/` and `examples/dating/`:
- `package.json` with `@vlting/ui` as a workspace dependency
- `vite.config.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `index.html`
- `src/` directory

### 2. Create brand configs
In `src/brands.ts` (within the example app):
```ts
import { createBrandConfig, defaultBrand } from '@vlting/ui'
import { neonBrand } from '../../../packages/design-tokens/src/brands/neon'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui'

export const brands = {
  default: { definition: defaultBrand, config: createTamagui(createBrandConfig(defaultBrand)) },
  neon: { definition: neonBrand, config: createTamagui(createBrandConfig(neonBrand)) },
}
```

### 3. Set up routing
Use `react-router-dom` with a layout like:
```
/                    → redirect to /default
/:brand              → brand home (component gallery)
/:brand/primitives   → primitives section
/:brand/components   → styled components section
/:brand/headless     → headless primitives section
/:brand/hooks        → hooks demos
```

Each `/:brand` segment resolves to a `<BrandLayout>` component that:
1. Reads the brand param from the URL
2. Looks up the corresponding config from the brands map
3. Wraps children in `<Provider config={config} key={brand}>`

A persistent top nav (outside the Provider) shows the brand selector and section navigation.

### 4. Build component showcase sections

Each section should display every component with:
- A heading with the component name
- A brief description
- One or more interactive examples showing key props/variants
- Visual states where applicable (hover, focus, disabled, etc.)

#### Primitives Section
- **Box** — basic container with different backgrounds/padding
- **Stack / VStack / HStack** — layout demos with gap variations
- **Text** — different font sizes, weights
- **Heading** — heading levels
- **Icon** — sample icons at different sizes (use a few from `@tamagui/lucide-icons`)
- **Divider** — horizontal and vertical
- **Spacer** — between elements to show spacing
- **Portal** — portal render target demo

#### Styled Components Section
- **Button** — variants (size, theme, disabled state)
- **Input** — variants (placeholder, disabled, sizes)
- **Card** — with different content compositions
- **Dialog** — trigger + open/close demo
- **Tabs** — multi-tab demo with content panels

#### Headless Section
- **HeadlessDialog** — custom-styled dialog built on headless primitive
- **HeadlessTabs** — custom-styled tabs
- **HeadlessCheckbox** — custom-styled checkbox

#### Hooks Section
- **useControllableState** — controlled vs uncontrolled input demo
- **useFocusTrap** — focus trap within a modal-like container
- **useKeyboardNavigation** — arrow key navigation demo

### 5. Brand selector UI
A simple nav bar at the top (outside any brand-specific Provider) with:
- Brand name buttons/links that navigate to `/:brand/...` (preserving the current section)
- Visual indicator of which brand is active
- This nav bar should use basic HTML/CSS (not Tamagui components) since it sits outside the Provider

### 6. Styling notes
- The showcase sections themselves USE the Tamagui components, so they inherit the active brand's tokens/themes
- Each component demo card should have a light background to contrast with the page
- Support both light and dark theme toggling (the Provider accepts `defaultTheme`)
- Add a light/dark toggle in the top nav alongside the brand selector

## Verification
- App starts with `npm run dev` (or yarn/bun equivalent)
- Switching brands visibly changes colors, radii, typography, and animation speeds
- All components render without errors in both brands
- Light/dark toggle works in both brands
- No TypeScript errors
