# Install and Configure Frontend Quality Tooling

## Objective

Install new MCP servers, evaluate community skills, and create a project-level frontend quality skill to strengthen the AI-assisted development loop for "front of frontend" concerns.

## Tasks

### 1. Evaluate and Install Stylelint MCP

Research the `ryo-manba/stylelint-mcp` server:
- Check if it's compatible with the project's setup (Tamagui uses CSS-in-JS, so Stylelint may not apply directly)
- If applicable: install it and add configuration
- If not applicable: document why in the commit message and skip

### 2. Create a Frontend Quality Skill

Create a skill at `.claude/skills/frontend-quality/SKILL.md` that activates when building or modifying UI components. This skill should encode the "front of frontend" quality checklist as actionable instructions for Claude.

The skill should cover:

**Semantic HTML Checklist**:
- Use `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation — never `<div onClick>`
- Use heading hierarchy in logical order (never skip levels)
- Use `<ul>`/`<ol>` for lists, `<table>` for tabular data
- Use `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>` for forms
- Use landmark elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`)
- In Tamagui: use `styledHtml()` for semantic elements, NOT `styled(View, { tag: 'button' })`

**DOM Optimization Checklist**:
- Never nest a block element inside an interactive element just for styling (e.g., `<button><div class="p-4">Text</div></button>` — put padding on the button)
- Flatten unnecessary wrapper `<div>`s — audit rendered output, not just source
- Compound components should not add extra DOM nodes beyond what's semantically needed
- Prefer using the component's own styling props over wrapper elements for spacing/padding

**Accessibility Checklist**:
- All interactive elements keyboard-operable (Tab, Enter, Space, Escape, Arrow keys as appropriate)
- Visible focus indicators (2px solid outline, 2px offset, meeting 3:1 contrast)
- Text contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG 1.4.3)
- Non-text contrast: 3:1 for UI components and graphical objects (WCAG 1.4.11)
- Touch targets: minimum 24x24px (WCAG 2.5.8), ideal 44x44px
- Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements (via `htmlFor`/`id`)
- Error states use `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby`
- Loading states use `aria-busy`
- Images have descriptive `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative)
- Use ARIA only when native HTML semantics are insufficient

**Spacing & Layout Checklist**:
- All spacing uses design tokens — no magic numbers
- Consistent spacing scale (the project uses `$0.5` through `$10`)
- Alignment follows Gestalt proximity principles
- Responsive: mobile-first, respect breakpoints

**Verification Step**:
After creating or modifying a component, the skill should instruct the agent to:
1. Run `AccessLint audit_html` on the component's rendered markup
2. Check for any WCAG violations
3. Verify DOM structure is minimal (no unnecessary wrappers)
4. Confirm all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible

### 3. Evaluate the Anthropic `frontend-design` Plugin

Research the official `frontend-design` skill from `anthropics/claude-code`:
- Read its SKILL.md content
- Assess compatibility with this project's "stability over novelty" philosophy (DESIGN_CONSTITUTION.md §2.7)
- If useful: install a **forked/adapted version** that removes any "bold aesthetic" guidance that conflicts with the design constitution
- If not useful: document why and skip

### 4. Evaluate `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`

Check if the project could benefit from `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`:
- Check current ESLint config (or Biome config) for existing a11y rules
- Since Biome already has `a11y` rules enabled, this may be redundant
- If Biome's a11y coverage has gaps that jsx-a11y fills: install it
- If redundant: document and skip

## Scope
- **Creates**: `.claude/skills/frontend-quality/SKILL.md`
- **May modify**: `.claude/settings.json` (if adding MCP server config — check where MCPs are configured first)
- **May create**: any config files needed for new tools
- **Does NOT modify**: any source code, constitution files, or contract files

## Important Notes
- The MCP servers (AccessLint, WCAG, Playwright, a11y, Lighthouse) are ALREADY configured — do not re-add them
- Check `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` for existing config
- The project uses Biome (not ESLint) as its primary linter — check `biome.json` for a11y rule coverage before adding ESLint plugins
