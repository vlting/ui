# Fix Pagination, Toggle, and Switch Components at UI Lib Level

Three component-level fixes for layout stability, visual state indication, and sizing correctness.

## 1. Pagination — Prevent Layout Shifts During Navigation

**File:** `packages/components/Pagination/Pagination.tsx`

**Problem:** Pagination controls move around as you paginate. The `PaginationFrame` uses `flexWrap: 'wrap'` (line 15), and as the page number changes, the total number of rendered items can change (e.g., ellipsis appearing/disappearing), causing the row to reflow.

**Fix options (implement the best one):**

**Option A — Fixed-width container:**
- Remove `flexWrap: 'wrap'` from PaginationFrame
- Use `flexWrap: 'nowrap'` and `overflow: 'hidden'` to prevent reflow
- Ensure all items have consistent widths regardless of digit count

**Option B — Stable item count:**
- Always render the same number of items by padding with invisible spacers
- The `computePageRange` function should return a consistent number of slots

**Option C — Min-width constraint:**
- Give the PaginationFrame a `minWidth` based on the expected max items
- Ensure page number buttons have a fixed `minWidth` so single-digit and double-digit numbers don't shift

**Recommended: Option C** — it's the simplest. Set a `minWidth` on each page number Button (e.g., the icon size for the current size prop), and remove `flexWrap: 'wrap'` from PaginationFrame. Buttons should have a consistent square size for numbers: `size="icon"` or explicit `minWidth` matching the `height`.

Additionally, the Ellipsis component's width should match the page number button width for that size.

## 2. Toggle — Visual State Indication

**File:** `packages/components/Toggle/Toggle.tsx`

**Problem:** The Toggle section looks terrible and has no clear indication of toggle state.

**Root cause:** The `default` variant (lines 47-50) has `borderWidth: 0` and `borderColor: 'transparent'`. When pressed, the only visual change is `backgroundColor: '$color4'` and `borderColor: '$borderColorHover'` — but since the border is 0px wide, the border color change is invisible. The result is a nearly invisible toggle with only a subtle background color change.

**Fix:**
- **Give the `default` variant a visible pressed state:** When `pressed: true`, apply a more prominent background color (e.g., `$color5` or `$color10`) and optionally show a border.
- **Add a visual pressed indicator:** Consider one of:
  - Stronger background contrast: unpressed = transparent, pressed = `$color10` (primary/accent color) with white text
  - Border indicator: always show a border, change color when pressed
  - Both: switch from outline style when unpressed to filled style when pressed (similar to how Button variants work)

**Recommended approach:** Match the Button's `default` vs `outline` visual language:
  - Unpressed: looks like an outline button (border, transparent bg)
  - Pressed: looks like a default/filled button (colored bg, light text)
  - This gives unmistakable visual feedback

Update both the standalone `Toggle` and ensure `ToggleGroup.Item` (which uses Tamagui's built-in ToggleGroup) also has clear pressed state styling. If Tamagui's ToggleGroup.Item doesn't show state well, apply custom styling.

## 3. Switch — Fix Knob Overlap and Vertical Centering

**File:** `packages/components/Switch/Switch.tsx`

**Problem:** The switch knobs overlap at the bottom and don't look vertically centered.

**Root cause:** The frame uses `size={SIZE_MAP[size]}` which maps to Tamagui tokens (`$3`, `$4`, `$5`). The thumb uses explicit pixel dimensions (`THUMB_SIZE_MAP = { sm: 16, md: 20, lg: 24 }`). The frame `padding={2}` should create a 2px gap around the thumb. If the frame's token height doesn't accommodate `thumbHeight + padding*2`, the thumb overflows.

Token size reference (from base.ts): `$3 = 28`, `$4 = 36`, `$5 = 44`.
- sm: frame height 28, thumb 16, needs 16 + 4 = 20 → fits (8px spare)
- md: frame height 36, thumb 20, needs 20 + 4 = 24 → fits (12px spare)
- lg: frame height 44, thumb 24, needs 24 + 4 = 28 → fits (16px spare)

The sizing math looks OK, so the issue might be:
1. The frame's `height` is being set but not `width`, causing the switch track to be too narrow
2. The thumb isn't vertically centered because the frame doesn't set `alignItems: 'center'`
3. The `borderRadius: 999` on the frame may be clipping oddly

**Fix:**
- Add explicit `width` to the frame for each size (should be ~2x the height for a nice switch proportion): e.g., sm: `width: 48`, md: `width: 60`, lg: `width: 72`
- Add `alignItems: 'center'` and `justifyContent: 'center'` to the frame (or just `alignItems: 'center'` since the thumb slides horizontally)
- Verify that Tamagui's Switch component positions the thumb correctly with these constraints
- If the thumb still overlaps, adjust `padding` from `2` to `3` or increase frame dimensions

## Scope
- `packages/components/Pagination/Pagination.tsx`
- `packages/components/Toggle/Toggle.tsx`
- `packages/components/Switch/Switch.tsx`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pagination controls stay in the same position as you navigate between pages (no jumping/reflowing)
- Toggle shows clear visual distinction between pressed and unpressed states
- ToggleGroup items also show clear pressed/unpressed states
- Switch knob is vertically centered with no overlap at edges
- All three components use theme tokens (no hardcoded colors/values)
- TypeScript compiles cleanly
