# Fix Animation Token Consistency and ScrollArea Stubs

## Objective

Address two minor quality gaps identified in the parity review:

1. **Animation tokens**: Accordion and Sidebar use inline CSS `transition` strings instead of Tamagui animation tokens. Replace with Tamagui animation system for consistency.
2. **ScrollArea stubs**: `Scrollbar`, `Thumb`, and `Corner` sub-components are empty stubs. Either implement them or explicitly document they are intentional no-ops.

## Instructions

### 1. Fix Accordion Animation

In `packages/components/Accordion/Accordion.tsx`:
- Find any inline `transition` CSS strings (e.g., `transition: 'transform 200ms ease'`)
- Replace with Tamagui animation props (e.g., `animation="fast"`) or use the animation tokens defined in the brand config

### 2. Fix Sidebar Animation

In `packages/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`:
- Find any inline `transition` CSS strings for width/collapse animation
- Replace with Tamagui animation props

### 3. Address ScrollArea Stubs

In `packages/components/ScrollArea/ScrollArea.tsx`:
- `Scrollbar`, `Thumb`, `Corner` are empty stubs that render nothing
- Option A: Remove them and update the spec to note ScrollArea uses CSS-based scrollbar styling only (no custom scrollbar track/thumb components)
- Option B: Implement them using the CSS scrollbar customization approach already in the Root component
- Recommended: Option A (document as intentional) since the component already handles scrollbar styling via injected CSS

### 4. Update Specs

Update `Accordion.spec.md`, `Sidebar.spec.md`, and `ScrollArea.spec.md` to reflect changes.

### 5. Verify

- Run tests: `npx jest packages/components/Accordion/ packages/components/Sidebar/ packages/components/ScrollArea/`
- Run type check: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Scope

- **Modifies**: `packages/components/Accordion/Accordion.tsx`, `packages/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`, `packages/components/ScrollArea/ScrollArea.tsx`
- **Modifies**: `packages/components/Accordion/Accordion.spec.md`, `packages/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.spec.md`, `packages/components/ScrollArea/ScrollArea.spec.md`
