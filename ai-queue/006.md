# Task 006: Styling & Polish Pass — shadcn-level quality

## Objective
Review ALL components (existing + newly added from Tasks 003-005) and ensure they meet shadcn/ui-level visual quality. This is a dedicated polish pass — no new components, just refinement.

## Quality Checklist

### 1. Neutral-first color system
Verify that every component:
- [ ] Uses neutral/gray colors by default (not accent)
- [ ] Only uses accent color in explicitly designated variants (`variant="default"` for Button/Badge, checked states for Checkbox/Radio/Switch, filled state for Progress/Slider)
- [ ] Destructive variants use a consistent red (from theme tokens, not hardcoded)
- [ ] Text colors use theme semantic tokens (`$color`, `$colorSubtitle`, `$colorMuted`)

### 2. Consistent spacing
- [ ] All internal padding uses token values (`$2`, `$3`, `$4`, etc.)
- [ ] No hardcoded pixel values for spacing
- [ ] Component sizing feels consistent across the library (buttons, inputs, selects should feel like they belong together)
- [ ] Check sizing at each brand: default (balanced), fun (slightly smaller), posh (slightly larger)

### 3. Border, shadow, and radius consistency
- [ ] Borders use `$borderColor` token, not hardcoded colors
- [ ] Border width uses token values (`$borderWidth.thin`, etc.)
- [ ] Radius uses token values (`$radius.3`, `$radius.4`, etc.)
- [ ] fun brand: verify borders are actually removed (all 0), shadows are flat
- [ ] posh brand: verify radius is 0 (square corners), borders are very thin, shadows are soft/diffused
- [ ] default brand: verify subtle standard styling

### 4. Interactive states
Every interactive component must have:
- [ ] **Hover:** Subtle background change (test with mouse)
- [ ] **Focus:** Visible focus ring using the brand's outline config
- [ ] **Active/Pressed:** Slightly darker/shifted state
- [ ] **Disabled:** Reduced opacity, no pointer events, no hover effect
- [ ] States must be visible in BOTH light and dark themes

### 5. Typography
- [ ] Headings use `$heading` font family
- [ ] Body text uses `$body` font family
- [ ] Font sizes use token scale, not hardcoded
- [ ] fun brand: verify serif font appears in headings
- [ ] posh brand: verify sophisticated serif in headings, lighter weights
- [ ] default brand: verify clean sans-serif throughout

### 6. Animation consistency
- [ ] All transitions use Tamagui animation tokens
- [ ] No jarring or slow animations
- [ ] fun brand: snappier animations
- [ ] posh brand: smoother, slightly slower animations
- [ ] default brand: standard timing

### 7. Dark mode
- [ ] Every component looks correct in dark mode
- [ ] Sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
- [ ] Borders and separators are visible in dark mode
- [ ] Accent colors are appropriately adjusted for dark backgrounds

## Process
1. Start the kitchen-sink app
2. Go through each component section systematically
3. Test with each brand (default, fun, posh)
4. Test both light and dark themes for each brand
5. Fix any issues found directly in the component source files
6. Document any brand-level token adjustments needed in the brand definition files

## Verification
- All components render correctly with all 3 brands x 2 themes = 6 combinations
- Visual quality matches shadcn/ui's level of polish
- No hardcoded colors, sizes, or spacing anywhere in component code
- Focus indicators work consistently
