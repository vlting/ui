# Task 003: Implement Missing Primitives

## Objective
Based on the component audit (`docs/component-audit.md` from Task 001), implement all missing primitive-level components. Primitives are low-level building blocks — layout containers, typography variants, and utility components.

## Likely Missing Primitives
(Confirm against the audit doc, but these are commonly needed across shadcn/Radix/Chakra):

- **Label** — Form label element, associates with an input via `htmlFor`. Critical for accessibility.
- **Separator** — Visual divider (we have `Divider` — confirm if it needs enhancement or if Separator is distinct)
- **AspectRatio** — Container that maintains a fixed aspect ratio
- **VisuallyHidden** — Renders content for screen readers only (srOnly)
- **Badge / Tag** — Small inline status indicator (could be primitive or simple component — place where audit says)
- **Image** — Styled image with fallback/loading state
- **ScrollArea** — Custom-styled scrollbar container
- **Skeleton** — Loading placeholder

## Implementation Guidelines

### Where to put files
- `packages/primitives/<ComponentName>.tsx` (uppercase, matching existing pattern like `Box.tsx`, `Text.tsx`)
- Export from `packages/primitives/index.ts`
- Re-export from `src/index.ts`

### Styling approach
- Use `styled()` from Tamagui to create the base component
- All primitives should be **unstyled by default** (or minimally styled) — they're building blocks
- They should respect the active Tamagui theme tokens (colors, spacing, etc.)
- Follow existing patterns: look at how `Box.tsx`, `Text.tsx`, `Divider.tsx` are built

### Known Tamagui v2 RC issues to watch for
- `styled()` with token defaults needs `// @ts-expect-error Tamagui v2 RC`
- `GetProps<>` resolves all token values as `undefined` — define props types from scratch or use the `_jsx-compat.ts` pattern
- Do NOT use `name` in styled() config — it causes TS errors in v2 RC

### Accessibility
- Label must use `<label>` element with proper `htmlFor`
- VisuallyHidden must use proper sr-only CSS technique
- All primitives must support `role`, `aria-*` props passthrough

## Verification
- All new primitives export correctly from `@vlting/ui`
- Each renders without errors in the kitchen-sink app
- TypeScript compiles (modulo known v2 RC issues)
