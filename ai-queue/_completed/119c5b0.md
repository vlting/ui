# 2️⃣ vlt-ui — Create .contract.md Files for Each Component

## Objective

Generate a `.contract.md` file for every component.

The contract defines:
- Public API
- Stability guarantees
- Versioning rules

## Rules
- Contracts are strict.
- Do not speculate.
- If implementation is ambiguous, ask.

## Claude Instructions

For each component:

1. Read:
   - `AI_CONSTITUTION.md`
   - `DESIGN_CONSTITUTION.md`
   - Component source file

2. Generate a `.contract.md` file containing containing the following REQUIRED structure, with content specific to that component:

# Component Contract — <ComponentName>

## 1. Public API

### Props

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|

Must include:
- Controlled/uncontrolled props
- Event callbacks
- Accessibility props

---

## 2. Behavioral Guarantees

- What this component guarantees
- What it will never do
- Side-effect boundaries

---

## 3. Accessibility Guarantees

- Keyboard support guarantees
- Screen reader guarantees

---

## 4. Styling Guarantees

- Token usage guarantees
- Theming compatibility
- Responsiveness expectations

---

## 5. Breaking Change Criteria

List what constitutes a breaking change:
- Removing props
- Changing behavior semantics
- Changing accessibility behavior
- Altering DOM role structure
