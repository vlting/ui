# Task 005: Implement Complex Composed Components

## Result
6 high-priority complex composed components added:
- Accordion — multi-section expandable with single/multiple mode, collapsible flag
- AlertDialog — modal confirmation dialog extending HeadlessDialog
- Collapsible — single collapsible section with controllable state
- Table — semantic HTML data table with styled sub-components
- Breadcrumb — navigation breadcrumb trail with separator
- Form — form wrapper with field-level error/disabled propagation

All exported from barrel and src/index.ts. Build verified clean (only known v2 RC type issues).
