# Task: Fix Neon brand toggle not causing visual changes in kitchen-sink

## Result
Implemented dual-Provider approach: all brand Providers render simultaneously with display:none toggling.
Each Provider mounts once with its immutable config, avoiding Tamagui's singleton re-initialization issue.
Only the active brand renders the Outlet to avoid duplicate routes.
