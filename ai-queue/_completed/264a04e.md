# 002 — Card: Fix Footer Button Overlap

## Objective

In the "Basic Card" example, the buttons at the bottom of the card overlap with the card content. This is a component-level layout issue in `Card.tsx`.

## Context

- `CardContent` is styled with `flex: 1`, causing it to grow and potentially push into the footer area.
- `CardFooter` is a plain `YStack` with padding but no flex-shrink protection.
- When the card is stretched to fill available height (e.g., in a grid or flex container), CardContent expands and can overlap with CardFooter.

## Tasks

1. **Fix `CardFooter` in `packages/components/Card/Card.tsx`**:
   - Add `flexShrink: 0` to `CardFooter` to prevent it from being compressed by sibling flex growth.
   - Ensure `CardFooter` always occupies its natural height regardless of how much space `CardContent` claims.

2. **Verify `CardContent`** doesn't overflow into Footer:
   - Ensure `overflow: 'hidden'` or `overflow: 'auto'` is set on `CardContent` so that excess content scrolls within its bounds rather than overlapping footer.

3. **Verify `CardHeader`** has `flexShrink: 0` as well, to prevent header compression.

4. **Test** with the "Basic Card" example to confirm buttons no longer overlap content.

## Scope

- `packages/components/Card/Card.tsx`
