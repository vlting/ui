# Task 008: Final QA — Build, Typecheck, and Smoke Test

## Objective
Final quality gate. Ensure everything builds, typechecks, and runs correctly after all the preceding work.

## Steps

### 1. TypeScript compilation
```bash
yarn typecheck
```
Fix any new TypeScript errors introduced by Tasks 001-007. Known v2 RC issues (GetProps, styled() tokens) are acceptable with `@ts-expect-error` comments, but there should be no OTHER new errors.

### 2. Lint
```bash
yarn lint
```
Fix any lint violations.

### 3. Production build of kitchen-sink
```bash
cd examples/kitchen-sink && yarn build
```
Ensure the production build succeeds.

### 4. Smoke test all 3 brands
Start the dev server and manually verify:

#### Default brand (`/default`)
- [ ] Light theme: Clean, minimalist, YInMn Blue accents visible on primary buttons
- [ ] Dark theme: Proper contrast, accent color adjusted
- [ ] All component sections render
- [ ] Interactive states work (hover, focus, click)

#### Fun brand (`/fun`)
- [ ] Dark theme by default
- [ ] Pinkish-purple accents on primary elements
- [ ] No borders visible anywhere
- [ ] Serif headings (DM Serif Display or equivalent)
- [ ] Larger spacing, smaller sizes
- [ ] Generous radius (rounded)
- [ ] Thick focus outlines

#### Posh brand (`/posh`)
- [ ] Light theme by default
- [ ] Black accents on primary elements
- [ ] Square corners (0 radius)
- [ ] Very thin borders
- [ ] Soft, diffused shadows
- [ ] Sophisticated serif headings
- [ ] Slightly larger overall sizing

### 5. Cross-check component count
Compare the components listed in `docs/component-audit.md` against what's actually exported from `src/index.ts`. Every component marked as "to implement" in the audit should now be exported.

### 6. Clean up
- Remove any TODO comments that were resolved
- Remove any leftover debug code (console.log, etc.)
- Ensure no unused imports
- Ensure the `neonBrand` export is fully removed (no stale references anywhere)

## Verification
- `yarn typecheck` passes (or only has known v2 RC issues)
- `yarn lint` passes
- `yarn dev:kitchen-sink` works for all 3 brands
- Production build succeeds
- No console errors in browser
- Component count matches the audit spec
